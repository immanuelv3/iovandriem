When a friend had once told me about "Naturopaths" I thought this was something from another world. 
(I had no personal aversion against him- he was a friend)
After that meeting I have encountered two 
different Naturopaths in my home city (after I had encountered one Natural Medicine practitioner all
ready before)
(I was all ready confronted with Naturopathy through different books and practitioners on&for my disease "SIBO"
(Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth) and a personal healing protocol with natural antibiotics a.o. and also in 
general a very personal interest therefore).
The meetings with them in my city of Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, have changed my life and health!
